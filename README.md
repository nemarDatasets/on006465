Overview

This dataset, named 3M-CPSEED, consists of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings obtained from 20 participants engaged in imagined speech tasks. 3M-CPSEED holds significant implications for speech neurophysiology research, not only facilitating exploration of neural activity differences across pinyin articulations but also enabling robust transfer learning studies for other alphabetic languages.

Data Collection

Participants: 20 healthy, right-handed individuals (average age: 24.55 years, standard deviation: 2.58 years; 11 females, 9 males) who are native Chinese speakers.

Materials: To strike a balance between comprehensively capturing the articulatory features of the Chinese phonological system and maintaining a concise, controllable set of stimuli, we selected this set of Pinyin sounds: Finals: "a, i, u, ü"; Initials: "m, f, j, l, k, ch".

Procedure: Participants read Pinyin displayed on a screen at 'speak', 'Silently articulated' and 'imagined' phase. Each participant completed 4 blocks of 1600 trials in total.
